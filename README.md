# Coral Bleaching Project - Natura - Ocean Project/FIAP

In the Coral Bleaching project, we are targeting the acidification of the water and the increase in ocean temperatures that directly influence coral bleaching. The solution requires a carbon dioxide sensor, as well as a database from the NOA - National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Images are also important in this case and we added images contributed by the GBIF - Global Biodiversity Information Facility. With the variables defined, we worked on the data in neural networks, making image identification and predictions.
