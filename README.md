In the Coral Bleaching project, in addition to concerns about water acidification, rising ocean temperatures are also a major influence on bleaching, and we saw the need to have a carbon dioxide sensor, as well as a database from the NOA - National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Imagery is also important in this case and we added images contributed by the GBIF - Global Biodiversity Information Facility. With the variables defined, we worked on the data in neural networks, image identification and prediction.
